For the rest of this guide, you'll be working with a simple todo
list manager that runs on Node.js. If you're not familiar with Node.js,
don't worry. This guide doesn't require any prior experience with JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](/get-started/get-docker.md).
- You have installed a [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- You have an IDE or a text editor to edit files. Docker recommends using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Get the app

Before you can run the application, you need to get the application source code onto your machine.

1. Clone the [getting-started-app repository](https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app/tree/main) using the following command:

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
   ```

2. View the contents of the cloned repository. You should see the following files and sub-directories.

   ```text
   ├── getting-started-app/
   │ ├── .dockerignore
   │ ├── package.json
   │ ├── README.md
   │ ├── spec/
   │ ├── src/
   │ └── yarn.lock
   ```
